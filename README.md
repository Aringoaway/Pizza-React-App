# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### ` npm run server`

Switch on the server to receive data, in another terminal window.\
This will work on port [http://localhost:3001/pizzas](http://localhost:3001/pizzas).
